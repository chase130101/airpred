Still to do:
- Have scripts that take input files so that stuff isn't hard-coded
- Write a general validation/cross-validation script
- Write script to measure accuracy of imputations
- Get random forest imputations saved (memory problems here)
- Do train, validation, test split in separate file than imputation script
- Actually impute values in a different script than the one that fits the imputation models
- Create an xgboost model
- Fix neural net
- Try GP as first pass modeling approach (predictions can be used as features in other models)
- Documentation of everything
- Compile results to create poster/website
